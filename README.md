Open python IDE

Create a new file and copy the calculate_balances function code into it. Save the file with a .py ending, for example calculate_balances.py.

Create a CSV file containing the transactions that you want to process. The file should have the following format:

The first row should contain the column names "customer_id", "date", and "amount".
Each  row after should contain the customer ID, date, and amount for a single transaction, separated by commas. The date should be in the format "MM/DD/YYYY".
Save the CSV file in the same directory as the Python script.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script and CSV file.

Run the Python script by typing python calculate_balances.py followed by the name of the CSV file. For example:
python calculate_balances.py transactions_file.csv
Or the Python script can be ran by entering python calculate balances.py
followed by transactions_file.csv> results.txt into the terminal
